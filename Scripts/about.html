            Yoda (/ˈjoʊdə/) is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe,
            first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. He is a
            small, green humanoid alien who is powerful with the Force and
            served as Grandmaster of the Jedi Order. In The Empire Strikes Back,
            Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, who reprised the role
            in Return of the Jedi, the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy.
            Outside of the films, the character has been mainly voiced by Tom
            Kane, starting with the 2003 Clone Wars animated television series.
            Yoda has since become an iconic figure in popular culture due to his
            distinct pattern of speech and role as a wise mentor. In his first
            appearance in the original trilogy, Yoda is described as the mentor
            of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and lives in exile on the swamp planet of
            Dagobah. He trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force until his
            death at the age of 900 in Return of the Jedi, though he later
            returns as a Force spirit. In the prequel trilogy, Yoda leads the
            Jedi High Council and trains the young generations of Jedi until
            they are assigned to a master. When the Clone Wars breaks out, he
            becomes a general in the Galactic Republic's army and leads several
            legions of clone troopers. Yoda is one of the few Jedi to survive
            the events of Order 66 at the end of the war, and faces off against
            Emperor Palpatine, but is outmatched and forced to go into hiding.
            Yoda's spirit appears again in the sequel trilogy, advising an older
            Luke and empowering Rey to face a revived Palpatine.
